## Submit your contributions as [pull-requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/)
Install [frigg-runner](https://github.com/frigg/frigg-runner) and run `frigg` inside the
project folder. If it reports all good, most of all the points below are good.

**Please:**

* Write tests for everything.
* Follow pep8.
* Use isort to ensure you follow the import ordering guidelines. `make isort` will fix it.
* Write descriptive commit message about what the commit does, not what the code does.
* Include a good description of why you suggest the changes in pull-request.

If you have any questions or want help with your first pull-request please contact us
at webkom@abakus.no or in the abakus channel on efnet.
